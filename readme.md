# S3 Static Website

## Description

This project demonstrates a performant, cheap, static website using AWS services. It can be used to deploy a static website such as those generated by 11ty.

### AWS service utilisation

 * Route53 for DNS
 * ACM for SSL certificates
 * CloudFront as the CDN
 * Lambda@Edge for pretty URLs (directory indexes)
 * S3 for content storage

## How to use this repo

This repository assumes that you are hosting your DNS in Route53 and have a pre-configured hosted zone. You can use the unused `cloudformation/hosted-zone.yaml` as reference for expected stack exports.

To deploy a website review the deploy.sh script. It should be called as following:

```shell
./deploy.sh website_domain optional_git_repo_name optional_git_repo_org
```
